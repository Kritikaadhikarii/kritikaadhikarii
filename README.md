## About Me
I'm a UI/UX Designer and a frontend developer (also a full stack developer at weekends when it comes to sovling real life problems with software as solution). I love designing and coding. I'm a very outgoing person, a passionate leaner, great team member and a supportive friend.

## Fun Fact
You'll never find me idle, I'd either be working on something or learning something new each day. I have a great passion for data science, AI & ML as well.
